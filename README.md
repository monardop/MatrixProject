# MatrixProject
This project is about different operations that you can do with matrices. I am going to apply the knowledge that I obtained on Algebra and Programming. My main objective is to make an app capable of doing diverse types of operations, like multiply or generate basis and kernel/range of a vector space or a linear mapping. 
For the moment, I only know how to make this on a static way. But in future actualizations I will make this dynamic. Initially this will function with 5x5 matrix as a max, but then I will delete this and add a dynamic way to generate in real time the dimension of the matrix.
